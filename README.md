FileMaker--Get-Record-Table
===========================

This is an easy to use script that takes in an ID and will return the table that the ID belongs to wrapped in a variable.

The only prerequisite is that your tables need to have a field called "id". The field can be formatted either "ID" or "id", and that can be changed in the preferences of the script using the predefined variable.
